## 🦸 Holy plot points!

**Sidekick** is a creative storyteller's trusty companion! Map out the connections between characters, locations, and "sections" of your outline.

## 🤔 Goal

Sidekick aims to provide an intuitive way for writers to plan and connect important elements of their story. The goal is to facilitate the process of discovering connections and through-lines that serve your creative vision.

## 🌱 Project Status

**Sidekick** is early in its journey. Here's the plan:

### **Core features**

    - 🔨 **Sections**: Create and easily flesh out story moments/scenes. Each can link to related characters and locations
    <!-- - ⏹️ **Themes**: Lay out over-arching ideas that tie your story together, and easily view them from anywhere in the app -->
    - ✅ **Characters**: Describe your story's characters with several useful prompts
        - 🔨️ **Character dynamics**: Link characters to each other and describe their relationship
    - ✅ ️ **Locations**: Describe your story's vibrant settings
