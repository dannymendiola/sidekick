## ü¶∏ Holy plot points!

**Sidekick** is a creative storyteller's **trusty companion!** Effortlessly map out the connections between characters, locations, themes, and moments.

Currently under development for [SvelteHack 2024](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/2024). This puts the target for release at January 10th, 2025

## ü§î Why?

**Sidekick** aims to provide an intuitive way for writers to plan and **connect** important elements of their story. The goal is to facilitate the process of discovering connections and through-lines that serve your creative vision.

## üå± Project Status

**Sidekick** is early in its journey. Here's the plan:

### **Core features**

- ‚úÖ **100% local**: Sidekick is a [local-only](https://dev.to/alexanderop/what-is-local-first-web-development-3mnd) app. Your projects never leave your device, keeping them away from servers, AI datasets, or anywhere else you may not want them. This applies whether run through your browser or installed as a web app (PWA).
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Export and import**: Easily save your story to a file, for safekeeping or to import on another device
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Progressive web app**: Install **Sidekick** as a PWA, allowing for an app-like experience on any device (or stick with the browser)
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Create story elements**: Flesh out your story with moments, themes, locations, and interrelated characters
    - ‚èπÔ∏è **Moments**: Create and easily flesh out story moments/scenes. Each can link to important characters, locations, and themes
    - ‚èπÔ∏è **Themes**: Lay out over-arching ideas that tie your story together, and easily view them from anywhere in the app
    - ‚úÖ **Characters**: Describe your story's characters with several useful prompts
    - ‚èπÔ∏è **Character dynamics**: Link characters to each other and describe their relationship
    - ‚èπÔ∏è **Locations**: Describe your story's vibrant settings

### **Feature backlog**

- ‚èπÔ∏è **Live link suggestions**: Mention an unlinked story element, and Sidekick will automatically suggest a link, making it easy to create potentially useful connections

## ‚ú® Getting started

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a work in progress, and missing key features. If you're here for a functional app, please check again later

When core features are implemented, this app will be available for use in any modern browser. 

If you'd prefer to run it on your own machine for full control, you can always do so straight from the source:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) if necessary
2. Open a terminal in the folder where you'd like to download Sidekick, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannymendiola/sidekick
cd sidekick
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If the app doesn't open in your browser automatically, you can access it by entering `localhost:2127` in the browser address bar

To stop the app, type `q` in the running terminal and enter

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

Sidekick is currently a solo project as part of a hackathon, so I won't be looking at any contributions until after submission (January 10), and will not make any merges until after final results.

That said, contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, feel free to open an issue or PR.
